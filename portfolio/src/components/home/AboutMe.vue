    <hr />
    <p class="text-lg mt-5">
      I specialize in Web, Mobile, and Desktop development using ASP.NET MVC, ASP.NET Core,
      WinForms, WCF, and Xamarin. I have dabbled in native mobile development with Android and
      Kotlin. I graduated from UW Ohskosh in 2015 with a degree in Computer Science with an emphasis
      in Software Engineering. I absolutely love this field. There are endless amounts of things one
      can create. From refactoring legacy programs to creating bleeding edge applications - I enjoy
      it all. I have experience in working on code bases both large and small. I have used both
      agile and waterfall methodologies to deliver high performance applications to consumers in a
      timely manner. I have used other frameworks to develop applications, but I tend to stick to
      the .NET ecosystem when creating apps due to its mature nature and proven track record. In my
      spare time I enjoy creating learning new tech stacks, camping, playing basketball, watching
      Bucks Basketball (the greatest team in the NBA), and playing video games.
